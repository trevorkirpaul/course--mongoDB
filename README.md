### Backend Testing with MongoDB via Mongoose

**Tech learned:** Mongoose, MongoDB and Mocha

I started [this](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/) course on MongoDB created by Stephen Grider. I decided to take this course because I've always ran into issues whiles using mongoDB.

I've already learned so much and it's just hyping up coding in general for me. The more I learn the more I want to code and I'm thankful for that.

That being said, I did put a project on hold so I could brush up on MongoDB. I realized a weakpoint and I decided to turn back and focus on it. It's definitely paying off and it's a practice I'm not afraid to do over and over again in the future. My plans are literally to be amazing at programming and I won't stop learning until I've achieved that goal.
